# iOS Compatibility Setup Guide

## Overview
This Flutter project has been configured for iOS compatibility with the following key configurations:

### 1. iOS Configuration Files Updated

#### Info.plist Changes:
- **App Transport Security**: Configured to allow HTTP connections to your backend server (172.20.10.2:8000)
- **Display Name**: Updated to "Event Management" for better user experience
- **Status Bar**: Configured for proper iOS status bar appearance
- **Orientation Support**: Supports both portrait and landscape orientations

#### Podfile Created:
- **iOS Deployment Target**: Set to iOS 12.0 for broad device compatibility
- **Framework Configuration**: Properly configured for Flutter iOS builds

### 2. Flutter Code Updates

#### Main.dart Enhancements:
- **System UI Configuration**: Added proper status bar and navigation bar styling
- **Orientation Control**: Configured supported orientations
- **App Bar Theme**: Enhanced for better iOS appearance

#### HTTP Configuration:

### 3. iOS Build Requirements

#### Prerequisites:
- Xcode 14.0 or later
- iOS 12.0+ deployment target
- CocoaPods installed

#### Build Commands:
```bash
# Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build for iOS
flutter build ios

# Run on iOS Simulator
flutter run -d ios

# Run on physical iOS device
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

### 4. iOS-Specific Considerations

#### Network Security:
- HTTP connections are allowed for development
- For production, consider using HTTPS
- App Transport Security exceptions are configured

#### UI/UX:
- Material Design 3 enabled
- iOS-style status bar configuration
- Proper orientation handling
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

#### Dependencies:
- All dependencies are iOS-compatible
- SharedPreferences works on iOS
- HTTP package supports iOS
- Provider state management works on iOS

### 5. Testing on iOS

#### Simulator Testing:
1. Open Xcode
2. Open iOS Simulator
3. Run `flutter run -d ios`

#### Device Testing:
1. Connect iOS device
2. Trust developer certificate
3. Run `flutter run -d <device-id>`

### 6. Production Considerations

#### App Store Requirements:
- Update baseUrl to HTTPS for production
- Remove NSAllowsArbitraryLoads from Info.plist
- Configure proper app icons and launch screens
- Test on multiple iOS versions

#### Security:
- Implement proper certificate pinning
- Use secure storage for sensitive data
- Follow iOS security guidelines

### 7. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:
- **Build Errors**: Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
- **Network Issues**: Check App Transport Security settings
- **UI Issues**: Verify orientation and status bar settings
- **Dependency Issues**: Update dependencies with `flutter pub upgrade`

#### Debug Commands:
```bash
flutter doctor
flutter devices
flutter run --verbose
```
